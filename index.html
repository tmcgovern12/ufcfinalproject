<p>
    I will be making a fan page for the UFC or "Ultimaye fighting champion"
    I will have a Home page explaining the origins of the UFC, leading figures, cover their buisness model basically just what the UFC. 
    Then each of the other 3 pages will be about one of the more popular weight divisions for fighters (light, middle heavy), talking about popular fighters and facts/info for each fighter featured.
